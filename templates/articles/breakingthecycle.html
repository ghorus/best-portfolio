    <title>Breaking the Cycle: Overcoming Burnout, Boosting Brain Health, and Finding Focus in High-Stress Times</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>As a software engineer and entrepreneur, the past few months have been some of the most challenging times of my life. 
        After being laid off and sending out over 400 applications without landing a job offer, I've faced chronic stress, burnout, and discouragement. 
        Balancing the need to make money, pursue personal growth, and sustain my energy has left me feeling lost and overwhelmed. 
        This article explores practical strategies to break free from these struggles, optimize brain health, and regain focus. 
        Whether you're navigating financial pressure, job searches, or building your own business, this guide will help you prioritize well-being and performance.</p>
    <h1>1. Mindset Reset: Reframing Overthinking and Anxiety</h1>
    <p>
        Overthinking and perfectionism often lead to paralysis. I’ve found myself overanalyzing everything—wanting to be super perfect for entrepreneurship while also feeling discouraged by doing so much with no results. 
        One strategy that has helped me calm my body and mind is the 4-7-8 breathing exercise, which involves inhaling for 4 seconds, holding for 7 seconds, and exhaling for 8 seconds. 
        This calms the nervous system and reduces anxiety. From there, I focus on positive thinking by taking small steps daily and writing down what I’ve tried—what worked, what didn’t, and why. 
        Journaling about my goals and values has also helped me stay focused and more intentional with my efforts.

    <h1>2. Brain and Body Optimization: Nutrition and Sleep Tips</h1>
    <p>Chronic low energy has been one of my biggest struggles. I’ve often wondered what nutrients are even worth considering. I’ve started focusing more on eating vegetables and fruits, especially when my wife encourages me to stick to healthier choices even when I don’t feel like it. 
        I also make an effort to avoid junk foods, like blueberry muffins that I crave but ultimately make me feel icky afterward. </p>
