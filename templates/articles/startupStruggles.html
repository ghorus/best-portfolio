        <h1>Struggling with the First Step in Building a Startup: Finding a Target Audience and Market Validation</h1>
    
        <p>Starting a business is overwhelming, especially when you're not sure where to begin. 
            For me, the biggest struggle has always been the first step—figuring out who my target audience is and how to validate that there's actually a market for the idea. 
            I’ve had countless ideas swirling around, but when it comes to narrowing down which one to pursue, it's like a never-ending cycle of uncertainty.</p>
    
        <p>The first piece of advice you hear over and over again is to find your target audience. Okay, great—so who exactly are these people? 
            I’ve come to realize that, ultimately, people are just people. 
            Trying to define a persona, like a young Chinese kid who plays badminton and dreams of getting into a prestigious school, feels a bit forced. 
            Sure, I could make up scenarios—maybe this person struggles with academics, family bonding, self-confidence, or even finding a girlfriend. 
            But is that really helpful? How do I pinpoint the right pain points that would lead to a profitable service?</p>
    
        <p>The problem is, there could be a million different things that might resonate with people. 
            Maybe my target audience is someone who’s struggling with weight issues, or perhaps they’re grappling with feeling like an outsider because of cultural barriers. Maybe they want to make extra money but have no clue how to hustle. 
            It’s easy to get lost in the sea of possibilities, and the more I think about it, the harder it is to figure out what I should focus on.</p>
    
        <p>In the past, I’d spent way too much time building an MVP for a service or product without first knowing if anyone actually wanted it. That’s where I keep getting stuck. 
            I’m not sure how to validate an idea before I go all in. So, I’ve thought of a few ways to test the waters:</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Content Creation:</strong> One idea is to post content on platforms like YouTube or write blogs to see what resonates with people. 
                If I can gauge what topics or ideas spark interest, I can narrow down the focus.</li>
            <li><strong>Sampling:</strong> Presenting a sample product to potential clients could give me valuable feedback and insight into what they’re looking for.</li>
            <li><strong>Cold Calling:</strong> I’ve considered cold calling local businesses, but honestly, that feels awkward. 
                It’s hard for me to balance the need for income with the desire to build genuine relationships. I’m still learning how to navigate that.</li>
            <li><strong>Reaching Out to Friends:</strong> Asking friends what they struggle with and how I could help feels like a good starting point, but what if they don’t know what they need either?</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>My main focus has always been on SaaS, but what if I can do more than just tech? Maybe I could branch out and offer services like logo design, 3D animation, video editing, photography, or even marketing. 
            There are so many possibilities, but how do I narrow it down? And where do I start?</p>
    
        <p>Websites often suggest doing surveys or interviews, but then the questions arise: where do I find people to interview? What questions do I ask? 
            Will it even lead anywhere? I hate the idea of expending energy without a guaranteed return, so the whole process can feel frustrating.</p>
    
        <p>Eventually, I realized that instead of getting caught up in analysis paralysis, maybe I should take a simpler approach. 
            What if I started by just doing something low-effort and seeing what catches on? That’s when I thought of blogging or making YouTube videos. 
            At least this way, I can throw out a big net and see what people are interested in. 
            From there, I can adjust and figure out a way to provide a service that matches the demand.</p>
    
        <p>Another piece of advice I’ve read is to pick a niche, but let’s be real—picking a niche when you don’t even know what your audience wants feels nearly impossible. 
            So, I’ve decided to focus on topics that genuinely interest me, all while keeping an eye on what resonates with my audience. I’m trying to approach this like an experiment—share what I’m passionate about, and see if anyone else finds it interesting. 
            If there’s a spark of interest, then I’ll figure out how to build a service around it.</p>
    
        <p>So here I am, writing a blog about the very thing I’ve been struggling with: how to find my place in the startup world. 
            The journey is messy, and the first step feels like the hardest part, but maybe by sharing my thoughts and experiences, I’ll find some clarity along the way. After all, it’s better to start somewhere than remain stuck in the cycle of overthinking.</p>
