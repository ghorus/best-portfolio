        <h1>How Reading Books Helped Me Channel My Overthinking into Growth and Self-Discovery</h1>
    
        <p>As someone who has always been a chronic overthinker, I found myself constantly caught up in a cycle of wondering what to do with my life. 
            I struggled with restlessness and a deep curiosity about various topics. But one day, I realized that instead of letting this overthinking paralyze me, I could channel all that mental energy into something productive: reading.</p>
    
        <p>Books, unlike a quick Google search or a YouTube video, offer something entirely different. 
            They provide a wealth of in-depth content about specific topics, rather than just surface-level information. 
            Whether it's about brain psychology, how to socialize, journaling, politics, mangas, or even learning how to draw and cook, books have given me an incredible opportunity to explore the things I’m currently yearning to learn more about.</p>
    
        <p>One of the most best things about reading is that you don’t have to read every single page of a book to benefit from it. 
            My approach is simply by asking myself, “What am I curious about right now?” From there, I come up with a list of topics and search for books that cover them. I might grab 10 to 20 books that catch my eye, based on their synopses or by skimming through the pages. If a book sparks my interest, I either check it out and take it home, or I read it on the spot.</p>
    
        <p>Sometimes, I stumble upon books or topics within them that are completely unrelated to my initial interest, but end up sparking a new curiosity altogether. 
            These unexpected discoveries often lead to new inspirations and insights. On the flip side, there are times when I pick up a book and don’t end up touching it at all—and that’s okay too. Libraries are forgiving spaces, and they have designated spots for returning books when you're done (or when you’ve moved on to something else).</p>
    
        <p>One of the places that made this process even easier for me was the Huntington Library. 
            I loved how I could check out books on my own and return them through their self-book return system. This not only added convenience but also gave me the freedom to explore without feeling embarrassed about reading certain books—books that might seem strange to others but align with my genuine interests.</p>
    
        <p>Moving to Orange County and being away from my friends has been challenging, especially as I didn’t know anyone here. 
            But reading books has fulfilled that craving for overthinking and given me a way to connect with myself. 
            It’s been my way of grounding myself in a world where I sometimes feel isolated. 
            Through books, I’ve been able to dive deep into the things I care about, learn new skills, and most importantly, discover new perspectives that have enriched my life.</p>
    
        <p>Overall, books have not only helped me deal with my overthinking but have also turned that overthinking into something productive and enriching. 
            They’ve become my companions in self-growth, and I now look at them as tools that have shaped my life in ways I never imagined.</p>
